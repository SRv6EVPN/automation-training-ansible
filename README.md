# automation-training-ansible

Welcome to the automation-training-ansible lab!

Here, you will be able to practice some of your network automation skills, including:
* Python
* Jinja templating
* CVP APIs
* Git
* Ansible
* ansible-cvp collection
* ansible-avd collection

This lab was created to be run on an AVD environment (as everything will be pre-installed).
However, you can run it anywhere by installing manually the different tools used, and by changing the IP addresses to match your environment.

## Getting started
1. Open the `Programmability IDE` in your AVD web interface

2. Open a terminal (Top-left lines icon > Terminal > New terminal), and run the following commands:
```
cd /home/coder/project/labfiles
git clone https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/automation-training-ansible.git
```

The instructions for each lab are located in each lab directory (`Readme.txt` file).

3. Change the directory and run your first lab:
```
cd automation-training-ansible/Day-1/Lab-1
python3 example.py
```

Modify this python file to complete the first lab.

## Good luck!
